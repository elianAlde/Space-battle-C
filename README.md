# Space-battle-C

## Premise

This program was created during the fourth year of my high school path as an end-of-year project (year 2017/2018).
The program is not perfect but it works and it has been entirely realized without the help of graphic libraries like GDK.

## Install instruction
To run the game you need a GCC compiler to compile the cpp file.

To access the program, follow these steps:

 - Downlad a GCC compiler as DEV C++.
 - Open the file and click to compile and run
 - The compiler
 - The compiler will have created an executable file in the cpp file folder
 - Click to exe file and enjoy the gime

Enjoy exploring and have fun with the quiz!
