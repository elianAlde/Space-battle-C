# Space-battle-C

## Premise

This program was created during the fourth year of my high school path as an end-of-year project (year 2017/2018).
The program is not perfect but it works and it has been entirely realized without the help of graphic libraries like GDK.

## Install instruction

To run the game you need a GCC compiler to compile the cpp file.

To access the program, follow these steps:

 - Downlad a C++ IDE as DEV C++.
 - Open the file and click to compile and run.
 - The compiler will have created an executable file in the cpp file folder.
 - Click to exe file and enjoy the game.

## Program goal

Follow the tutorial inside the game but this is a preview of the main menu:
